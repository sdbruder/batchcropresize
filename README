batchcropresize v 1.0
---------------------

batchcropresize is a small python utility made to batch crop & resize a group 
of image files. Ive wrote it to batch process a series of images to put in a 
crappy and slow digital photo frame.

Originally written in mac os with python and PIL, it should work with Linux 
and Windows with the correct python and PIL, but Ive not tested it so far 
outside Mac OS Lion.


usage: batchcropresize [-h] [--resolution 9999x999] [--recursive] [--inplace]
                       [--dry]
                       files [files ...]

Batch resize and crop

positional arguments:
  files

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --resolution 9999x999, -r 9999x999
  --recursive, -R
  --inplace, -i
  --dry, -d
